# API Management System

The API Management System is a robust platform that allows users to manage APIs effectively, including authentication, authorization, and access control. This system provides a centralized interface for API management, making it easier for developers to monitor, secure, and control access to their APIs.

## Features

- **API Listing**: Retrieve a list of all APIs managed by the system.
- **API Details**: Get detailed information about a specific API, including its name, description, base URL, authentication type, and access control settings.
- **API Creation**: Add new APIs to the system, specifying details such as name, description, base URL, authentication type, and access control settings.
- **API Update**: Update existing APIs with new information, including name, description, base URL, authentication type, and access control settings.
- **API Deletion**: Delete APIs from the system as needed.
- **Authentication**: Secure API access using API keys for authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API Management System, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain API Key**: Register with the API Management System and obtain an API key from the user dashboard.
2. **API Integration**: Integrate the API Management System into your application using the provided API endpoints.
3. **Authentication**: Include the API key in the headers of each request for authentication.
4. **API Management**: Use the API endpoints to manage APIs effectively, including listing, retrieving details, adding, updating, and deleting APIs.

## API Endpoints

- **List APIs**: `/apis` (GET)
- **Get API Details**: `/apis/{id}` (GET)
- **Add API**: `/apis` (POST)
- **Update API**: `/apis/{id}` (PUT)
- **Delete API**: `/apis/{id}` (DELETE)

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the API Management System API with Python's requests library:

```python
import requests

# API Management System API base URL
base_url = 'https://api.apimanagement.com/v1'
# Replace '<API_KEY>' with your actual API key
api_key = '<API_KEY>'

# Function to list all APIs
def list_apis():
    url = f'{base_url}/apis'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'ApiKey {api_key}'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return f'Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}'

# Example usage
apis = list_apis()
print('List of APIs:', apis)
```

## Conclusion

The API Management System provides a powerful solution for managing APIs with authentication. With features for listing, retrieving details, adding, updating, and deleting APIs, along with secure authentication using API keys, the API Management System simplifies the process of managing APIs effectively.
